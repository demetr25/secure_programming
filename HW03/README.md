Implement RSA algorithm (key generation, encryption and decryption). Do not use any crypto helper libraries.

Implement brute force decryption, knowing crypted text and public key.

Limit your work within positive LONG bits (64).

No hardcoded values, input validation!!

Find bigest longint n value, that your laptop can decrypt under 5 minutes. Write the value into README.md.
